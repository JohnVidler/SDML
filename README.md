# SDML - The 'Simple' Document Markup Language

A 'Simple Document Markup Language' that will no doubt prove to be anything but 'Simple'

Written mostly as a learning tool, so I can hopefully become better at Python, but I'm uploading it here in the remote
chance that it might be of some use to anyone.

PRs welcome, if anyone wants to extend this monster :)
